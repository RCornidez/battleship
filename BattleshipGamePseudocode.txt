# Description: Simulates a 2-player battleship game (human vs. bot) using brute-force pattern matching. 
# Input: User ship placements and shots; Bot uses random positions
# Output: Game result - winner announcement after all ships sunk


# Initialize game
create 2 players: human, bot
create 2 boards (10x10)
assign 3 ships each: crusier, submarine, destroyer
set active_player = human

# Ship placement - human
for each ship in human_ships:
    repeat:
        prompt placement input
        if placement valid:
            place ship
            break
        else:
            show error

# Ship placement - bot
for each ship in bot_ships:
    repeat:
        generate random placement
        if placement valid:
            place ship
            break
